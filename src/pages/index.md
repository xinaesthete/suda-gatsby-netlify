  title: Who are we?
  description: >
    A small charity, based in Winchester, UK.

    Sumbawanga Development Action (SUDA) is UK registered charity #1111900 â€“ since 2005.
description: The idea came well before the formal establishment of the
  organisation. After visiting the villagers in Kalalasi we discovered that
  local people there needed some help to improve their productivity, health and
  education infrastructure. So we raised some funds for a project to help women
  potters improve their productivity with a more efficient kiln. We approached
  ITDG, now Practical Action, who gave us plans for a better bonfire kiln.

      text: "Advancement of education. It goes without saying that ensuring young
        people have a proper education is fundamental to the future of the
        community. That doesn't just mean text-books: we strive to ensure that
        children have adequate living conditions in which to learn and grow
        safely."

      text: Preserving and protecting good health. Whether it be treatment of illness
        or access to clean water, there are great challenges faced by rural
        communities. The right assistance can have a profound impact.

      text: Greening the environment. For people on the front-lines of the climate and
        ecological emergency we all face, restoring plant life is critical.
    - image: /img/helping_hand.svg
      text: Relieving poverty and hardship among the inhabitants of Sumbawanga. For
        those in accute need, a helping hand to pull them onto their feet can
        allow them to build a dignified and stable life.
    - image: /img/infrastructure.svg
      text: Providing financial and material assistance in order to improve
        infrastructure. There is no lack of talent or ingenuity in the
        community, but in order to realise this potential it is sometimes
        necessary to facilitate construction that would simply not be feasible
        without outside help.
  heading: Our Objectives
  description: SUDAs vision is of communities that are self reliant in a
    sustainable environment. While they can do most things for themselves
    voluntarily, they do need some help.

  heading: Nothing to do with coffee
  description: We like drinking coffee, but any mention of it here is a hold-over
    from the template that the website started from, as opposed to anything
    relating to the activity of the charity that this site is supposed to be
    about. I'm not sure if this 'main' section appears anywhere, and it has
    three 'images' in it that I haven't managed to get rid of.
